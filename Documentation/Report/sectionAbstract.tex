\paragraph{} In today's world where humans are depending more and more on Artificial intelligence systems for various tasks, the complete interaction with an AI is not possible until the system knows the state of mind of human. And emotion is a very important feature for such interaction. Emotion can be judged from many aspects of human body such as facial expressions. Even the gender of a person can be recognised from their face image. Computers can be easily trained to extract emotions as well as gender information from facial images using image processing and machine learning. This system can be enhanced by adding face identification as well.
\paragraph{} Such systems help blind people and people affected with autism to have better interaction in social life. Also, it has many applications in fields like marketing or E-Learning, where engagement of customers or students can be measured using emotions.
