\paragraph{}The main aim of our project is to create a system for Blind Assistance by using Face Recognition, Emotion Recognition \& Gender Detection. Emotion and Face reognition are classic problems in image processing. Such systems have various real life applications.

\section{Scope}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Blind Assistance Systems :}\newline
	This is the main purpose of this project. We can easily create a head-mounted device with a camera. This can be used by the blind person to navigate. A voice assistance module can describe the view and help the person identify who is in front of him and gauge others emotions while communicating with them. Further enhancements can be made by adding obstacle detection module.
	
	\item \textbf{Robotics :}\newline
	Creating vision systems for robots is a difficult task.
